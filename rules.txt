.:: Rules ::.

You are one of the many possible players trying to guess a number. The range can be predefined, but the timeout is set depending on the level of difficulty.
Basically, everytime someone tries to guess the number, the number 'shifts'. Which means it gets +1 or -1 everytime someone fails. You have to find the number before everyone AND before the timeout!
Good luck and good game!
